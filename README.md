# dotfiles

## i don't know what i'm doing
this is my first serious attempt at trying to arrange and organize my dotfiles. there are probably tons of errors and/or other things that just seem weird about them right now. my goal is to become better at it all, but for now, this is what i have. if you see any errors or ways i could improve, please let me know. thanks!

## my heroes
i've incorporated stuff originally created by [zach seifts](http://github.com/zachseifts/) and [andrew burgess](http://github.com/andrew8088) into my files.
